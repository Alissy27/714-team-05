Hello!

I learned  course HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript Fundamentals from SoftServe and our team made site in his repo.
I made 2 sections: header and pricing. Burger menu in header works with JS. Cards in section pricing are displayed with JS also.
Here's small video-presentation of my work https://www.loom.com/share/47aa8ddff747458faec677b24a8a198d
